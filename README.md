# BiteWise
BiteWise AI tackles challenges by offering low-cost recipes, waste reduction tips, and seasonal ingredient recommendations to help users make the most of what‚Äôs available.
üåç Making an Impact:

BiteWise AI is not just another chatbot. It‚Äôs a scalable, sustainable, and practical solution directly addressing food insecurity while aligning with key UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

- SDG 2 (Zero Hunger): Offering low-cost, nutritious recipes using local ingredients.
- SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption): Educating users on reducing food waste.
- SDG 13 (Climate Action): Promoting seasonal, local ingredients to minimize carbon footprints.

üí° The Problem We Solved:

With 40% of some Indigenous communities experiencing food insecurity and sustainable food practices reducing household costs by up to 30%, we knew we had to build a solution that was scalable, accessible, and impactful. BiteWise AI tackles these challenges by offering low-cost recipes, waste reduction tips, and seasonal ingredient recommendations to help users make the most of what‚Äôs available.

üõ†Ô∏è The Build Process:

To bring BiteWise AI to life, we engineered a full-stack solution using Python Flask on the backend. We integrated NLP libraries to enable dynamic, real-time interactions with users. By leveraging the Spoonacular API, we provided personalized ingredient recommendations and recipe suggestions that were contextually relevant based on users' available ingredients. 

On the frontend, we created a user-friendly interface with a clean, responsive design, ensuring seamless accessibility across devices using HTML and CSS. 

We faced challenges in optimizing API requests and ensuring fast, accurate responses from the chatbot. But through careful algorithm design and efficient data handling, we fine-tuned our solution to deliver a smooth, responsive user experience
